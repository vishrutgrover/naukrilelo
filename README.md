# Model Design

We are employing VectorDB (ChromaDB) to query jobs based on applicant's preferences and skill set. Converting the job vacancies/internship postings on  LinkedIn we leverage OpenAI's text-embedding large model which captures the semantic meaning behind the text very accurately and boosts the recommendation algorithm. Using Cosine similarity we calculate the similarity between person's requirements and the job descriptions.
